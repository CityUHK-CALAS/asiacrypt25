      title: Introduction
      text: |
        The rapid progress of **quantum computing** threatens many classical cryptographic schemesâ€”including RSA and ECCâ€”making the shift to **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** urgent.  
        This hands-on tutorial walks you through designing and implementing a secure **post-quantum RISC-V IoT platform** on an FPGA.

        Key features include:

        * **CRYSTALS-Dilithium 3** digital-signature acceleration via hardwareâ€“software co-design  
        * An open, extensible **RISC-V** architecture that easily embeds custom PQC accelerators  
        * Full **FPGA prototyping**, giving you practical experience in building and optimizing secure embedded systems for a post-quantum world  

        We begin with an overview of **lattice-based PQC**, focusing on CRYSTALS-Dilithium 3â€”its architecture, security properties, and the computational, memory, and power demands it places on IoT devices. Youâ€™ll see how offloading compute-intensive operations to dedicated hardware drastically improves performance while balancing flexibility, resource usage, and throughput.

        Following the theory, youâ€™ll complete a step-by-step, live FPGA build:

        1. **RISC-V core** enhanced with a custom PQC accelerator  
        2. Integration with a **LoRa** module for low-power, long-range IoT connectivity  
        3. End-to-end FPGA workflowâ€”HDL coding, block-design creation, synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation  
        4. Real-time demonstration and evaluation of the finished system  

        To broaden your perspective, we will also briefly showcase our **GPU-based lattice-PQC prototypes**, outlining their design choices and performance metrics. Throughout the session, interactive discussions and live demos will give you deep insights into architectural design, hardwareâ€“software partitioning, and optimization techniques for resource-constrained, secure embedded platforms.

        > **Why this matters:** Bridging the gap between cutting-edge PQC algorithms and real-world IoT deployments equips you to build the secure systems tomorrowâ€™s connected devices will rely on.
